I have copied most of the dependencies and plugin management from the main repo.
When i have copied or adapted code from class i have stated so in that file.

I have done requirements R1, R2, R3  partially r4 and did not add any extra features(R5)

You start the local server by running LocalApplicationRunner in the fronteds test folder(frontend/src/test/java/no/kristiania), 
and you can access it on localhost:8080.
